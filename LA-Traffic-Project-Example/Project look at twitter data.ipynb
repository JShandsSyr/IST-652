      "Message:  @MLGACE From my experience, I would enjoy Cali. NOT LA, the traffic is so bad it ruins everything that‚Äôs amazing otherwise. Also the housing market is ooooof expensive. The weather is prime, the beaches are beautiful and the mountains are gorgeous. The cuisine options also top notch.\n",

      "Message:  @jasontrost Key differences are: LA is consistently very bad at junctions (110/101/5, 405). LA has few options to avoid traffic (limited metro and few dedicated bus lanes). LA has sprawl &gt; density w no central area (Manhattan, Loop). Creates a situation where you‚Äôre stuck in traffic a lot\n",
